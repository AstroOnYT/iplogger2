Before you do anything open a terminal in the same directory as the requirements.txt file.

Do "pip install -r requirements.txt" on the terminal.
Open the config.json file and type in your token and your desired prefix.
Save the config.json after you finish filling it.
Do your_prefix "log" | Example: "!log" it'll send you instructions on what do.
The code thats provided in the embed if you do "log" you'll have to put it in grabify's tracker.
Bitly is also another way to spoof a grabify link!

Enojoy IP logging people!

Warning, the target has the options to remove there data from the database.

Don't do illegal actions with the IP, including dos, or ddos, etc.

IMPORTANT: You'll also have to install python3 or higher, and you have to run "python main.py" 
on the terminal!
